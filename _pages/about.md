I go by the name of Lennon, an English native.

My relentless fascination lies in unravelling the concealed dimensions that often elude our perception.

This deep passion for the hidden world has propelled me on a lifelong metaphysical journey, driven by an unwavering pursuit of truth.

I prioritize living in harmony with nature and practice calisthenics for peak fitness.

My aim is to embrace the mysteries of the universe, honour the physical vessel, and embrace the potential for growth, transformation, and joy.
